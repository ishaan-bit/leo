# üîß Translation Not Working - Quick Fix

**Problem**: Translation is detecting Hinglish correctly (`lang_detected: "mixed"`) but NOT translating to English.

**Root Cause**: `GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY` is missing from Vercel environment variables.

---

## Current Behavior ‚ùå

```json
{
  "raw_text": "Kafi Dinon bad Doston Se Milkar bahut Achcha Laga",
  "normalized_text": "Kafi Dinon bad Doston Se Milkar bahut Achcha Laga",  ‚ùå Not translated
  "lang_detected": "mixed"  ‚úÖ Detection works
}
```

## Expected Behavior ‚úÖ

```json
{
  "raw_text": "Kafi Dinon bad Doston Se Milkar bahut Achcha Laga",
  "normalized_text": "It felt really good to meet my friends after a long time",  ‚úÖ Translated!
  "lang_detected": "mixed"
}
```

## Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add API Key to Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Environment Variables**:
   üëâ https://vercel.com/ishaan-bit/leo/settings/environment-variables

2. **Click "Add New"**

3. **Fill in**:
   - **Key**: `GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: `AIzaSyDmPj7YwSjEbrBayWmEc7-8qNJwknDWr5o` (from your .env.local)
   - **Environments**: ‚úÖ Production ‚úÖ Preview ‚úÖ Development

4. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy

**Option A: Automatic** (Recommended)
- Vercel will automatically redeploy after adding env var
- Wait ~2 minutes

**Option B: Manual**
- Go to: https://vercel.com/ishaan-bit/leo/deployments
- Click "..." on latest deployment
- Click "Redeploy"

### Step 3: Test

1. Go to: https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app
2. Submit reflection with Hinglish text: "Kafi Dinon bad Doston Se Milkar bahut Achcha Laga"
3. Check response - `normalized_text` should show: "It felt really good to meet my friends after a long time"

### Step 4: Verify Logs

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/ishaan-bit/leo/logs
2. Search for: `[TRANSLATION]`
3. Should see: `translate_success` with `lang: 'mixed'`

## Why This Happened

The API key is in your **local** `.env.local` (works on localhost) but was never added to **Vercel** (production environment).

**Local Dev**: ‚úÖ Translation works (API key present)  
**Production**: ‚ùå Translation skipped (API key missing)

---

## After Fix

Once the API key is added to Vercel:

- ‚úÖ Language detection will work (already working)
- ‚úÖ Translation will work (currently failing)
- ‚úÖ All future reflections will have proper English `normalized_text`

---

## Quick Verification

```bash
# After adding key and redeploying, test:
curl -X POST https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app/api/reflect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pigId": "test_pig",
    "originalText": "aaj bahut khush hun",
    "inputType": "notebook",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
  }'

# Should return:
# "normalized_text": "I am very happy today"
```
