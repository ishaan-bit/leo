He controls all the money — my salary goes into his account, he gives me an allowance like I'm a child. I tried to open my own account last month and he found out somehow, accused me of planning to leave him, didn't speak to me for a week except to say I was being selfish and ungrateful.\n\nMy family lives in [city], I haven't seen them in over a year. Every time I suggest visiting he finds a reason it's not a good time, or he'll come along and sit there sulking the whole time so I just stopped asking. My friends have mostly given up on me because I always cancel plans last minute when his mood shifts.\n\nLast week he punched the wall next to my head during an argument. He's never hit me directly but I'm terrified it's only a matter of time. I feel so stupid for staying but I have no money, nowhere to go, and I'm scared of what he'll do if I try to leave. Sometimes I think about just disappearing but I don't even know how to start.",
