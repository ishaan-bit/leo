# Hybrid Voice Transcription - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed (Commit d3b62f6)

### 1. Backend Transcription API
**File**: `apps/web/app/api/transcribe/route.ts`

- ✅ Deepgram SDK installed (`@deepgram/sdk@^4.11.2`)
- ✅ POST `/api/transcribe` endpoint created
- ✅ Accepts `FormData` with audio blob
- ✅ Uses Deepgram Nova-2 model (latest, fast + accurate)
- ✅ Auto-capitalization and punctuation enabled
- ✅ Returns: `{ transcript, confidence, latency }`
- ✅ Target latency: <800ms
- ✅ Supports: audio/webm, audio/mp4, audio/ogg, audio/3gpp
- ✅ Error handling for empty audio, API failures
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

**Testing**: Ready to test once DEEPGRAM_API_KEY is added to environment.

### 2. Implementation Specification
**File**: `VOICE_HYBRID_SPEC.md`

Complete technical specification including:
- Strategy 1: Web Speech API (Android Chrome, Desktop Chrome/Edge)
- Strategy 2: MediaRecorder + Deepgram (iOS Safari, fallback)
- Typing animation: 50ms per word
- Feature detection logic
- Platform compatibility matrix
- Cost estimation ($2-6/month for 1000 reflections)
- Performance metrics (Web Speech <200ms, Deepgram <800ms)
- Testing checklist for both platforms
- Deployment steps
- Rollback plan

### 3. Backup Created
**File**: `apps/web/src/components/atoms/VoiceOrb_BeforeHybrid.tsx`

Backup of current VoiceOrb implementation before hybrid changes.

## ⏸️ Pending (Awaiting User Approval)

### 1. Get Deepgram API Key
**Required**: Sign up at https://console.deepgram.com/
- Create new API key
- Add to Vercel environment variables: `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_key_here`
- **Note**: Deepgram offers $200 free credit (enough for ~16,000 minutes)

### 2. Apply Hybrid VoiceOrb Implementation
**File to modify**: `apps/web/src/components/atoms/VoiceOrb.tsx`

**Changes required** (see VOICE_HYBRID_SPEC.md for full details):
1. Add transcription strategy state (`'webspeech' | 'deepgram'`)
2. Add feature detection on mount
3. Add Web Speech API implementation (`startWebSpeech()`)
4. Update MediaRecorder to call Deepgram API (`transcribeWithDeepgram()`)
5. Add typing animation function (`animateTyping()`)
6. Update start/stop handlers for both strategies
7. Add cleanup on unmount

**Estimated effort**: 30-45 minutes to apply all changes + test

### 3. Testing
- Test on Android Chrome (should use Web Speech API)
- Test on iOS Safari (should use Deepgram)
- Verify typing animation (50ms per word)
- Verify enrichment pipeline triggers correctly
- Check latency targets (<200ms webspeech, <800ms deepgram)

### 4. Deploy to Production
- Commit hybrid VoiceOrb changes
- Push to main
- Vercel auto-deploys
- Verify in production on both platforms

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (User Action Required)
1. **Get Deepgram API key**: https://console.deepgram.com/signup
2. **Add to Vercel**: Settings → Environment Variables → Add `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`
3. **Review spec**: Read VOICE_HYBRID_SPEC.md
4. **Approve implementation**: Give agent green light to modify VoiceOrb.tsx

### After Approval (Agent)
1. Apply all VoiceOrb.tsx changes (9 steps from spec)
2. Test locally with both strategies
3. Commit and push to main
4. Monitor Vercel deployment
5. Production testing on Android Chrome + iOS Safari

## 📝 Commit History

### Commit d3b62f6 (Oct 29, 2025)
```
FEAT: Add Deepgram transcription API + hybrid voice spec

- Created /api/transcribe route using Deepgram Nova-2 model
- Installed @deepgram/sdk in apps/web
- Target latency: <800ms for server-side transcription
- Supports audio/webm, audio/mp4, audio/ogg formats
- Returns transcript with confidence score

VOICE_HYBRID_SPEC.md:
- Complete specification for hybrid voice implementation
- Strategy 1: Web Speech API (Android Chrome, Desktop - free, <200ms)
- Strategy 2: MediaRecorder + Deepgram (iOS Safari - paid, <800ms)
- Typing animation: 50ms per word (no interim results)
- Platform matrix and testing checklist included

Created VoiceOrb_BeforeHybrid.tsx backup before changes.
Ready to apply hybrid implementation pending DEEPGRAM_API_KEY.
```

**Files changed**: 5
- `apps/web/app/api/transcribe/route.ts` (NEW)
- `apps/web/package.json` (Deepgram SDK added)
- `apps/web/package-lock.json` (dependencies)
- `VOICE_HYBRID_SPEC.md` (NEW - 400+ lines)
- `apps/web/src/components/atoms/VoiceOrb_BeforeHybrid.tsx` (NEW - backup)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Deepgram Free Tier**: $200 credit = 16,000 minutes of transcription
2. **Web Speech API**: No cost, but requires network connection (uses Google's servers)
3. **Privacy**: Deepgram processes audio server-side (not stored, just transcribed)
4. **Fallback**: If Web Speech API fails, component will NOT fall back to Deepgram automatically (separate code paths based on feature detection)
5. **Typing Animation**: Adds visual polish, users see transcript appear word-by-word like keyboard typing
6. **No Interim Results**: Per user requirement, only final transcript is shown (no gray/interim text)

## 🔍 Testing Commands

```bash
# 1. Local development
cd apps/web
npm run dev

# 2. Open test page
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/test/voice (if test page exists)
# Or use VoiceOrb in reflection flow

# 3. Check console logs
# Look for: "[VoiceOrb] Using Web Speech API" or "[VoiceOrb] Using Deepgram fallback"

# 4. Test transcription
# Speak: "testing one two three"
# Expected: Words appear incrementally (50ms intervals)
# Expected latency: <200ms (Web Speech) or <800ms (Deepgram)
```
