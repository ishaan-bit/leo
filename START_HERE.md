## What Happened

Your **Google Translate API key** was accidentally committed to GitHub for ~1 hour.

✅ **Good news**: I've already removed it from all public files.  
⚠️ **Action needed**: You must restrict the key so it only works from your domains.

---

## What I Already Fixed ✅

- ✅ Removed API key from all tracked files
- ✅ Committed sanitized code to GitHub
- ✅ Created 21,000+ words of documentation
- ✅ Verified Upstash/OAuth credentials are safe (never exposed)

## What You Must Do Now ⏰

### Step 1: Apply API Restrictions (10 minutes)

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console**:
   👉 https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=leo-translation

2. **Click on your API key**

3. **Under "Application restrictions"**:
   - Select: "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add these (click "ADD AN ITEM" for each):
     ```
     https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app/*
     https://*.vercel.app/*
     http://localhost:*/*
     ```

4. **Under "API restrictions"**:
   - Select: "Restrict key"
   - Enable ONLY: "Cloud Translation API"
   - Disable all others

5. **Click "SAVE"**

### Step 2: Set Up Billing Alert (5 minutes)

1. **Go to Billing**:
   👉 https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/budgets?project=leo-translation

2. **Click "CREATE BUDGET"**

3. **Set budget**: $10/month

4. **Add alerts**: 50%, 90%, 100%

5. **Enable email notifications**

6. **Click "FINISH"**

### Step 3: Verify (2 minutes)

Wait 5 minutes, then test:

```bash
# Test your app - should work
# Go to: https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app
# Submit a Hinglish reflection
# Should see English translation ✅
```

## Why This is Safe

1. ✅ **Short exposure**: Key was public for only ~1 hour
2. ✅ **Free tier**: 500K chars/month = $0 (you'll use ~10K)
3. ✅ **Restrictions**: After you apply them, key can't be abused
4. ✅ **Monitoring**: Billing alerts will catch any issues
