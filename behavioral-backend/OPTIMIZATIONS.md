# Behavioral Backend Optimizations

**Date**: Oct 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ All 8 optimizations complete and tested

## Summary

Implemented 8 high-impact, low-effort improvements to the behavioral backend based on detailed technical analysis. All acceptance tests continue to pass while providing more nuanced emotional dynamics.

---

## 1. ERI Arousal Scaling ✅

**Problem**: ERI=0.67 for calm positive text (intensity=0.0) was too high, penalizing quiet positive reflections.

**Solution**: Changed arousal weight in ERI calculation from fixed `0.5` to intensity-scaled `(0.25 + 0.5 * intensity)`.

```python
# BEFORE: dynamics.py compute_ERI()
ERI = valence_delta + 0.5 * arousal_delta

# AFTER:
arousal_weight = 0.25 + 0.5 * expressed_intensity  # Scales 0.25 to 0.75
ERI = valence_delta + arousal_weight * arousal_delta
```

**Results**:
- Calm positive ("Met my friends..."): ERI **0.47** (was 0.67) ✅
- Emphatic positive ("SO many days!!"): ERI **0.41** (lower due to congruence) ✅
- Quiet reflections no longer over-penalized

---

## 2. Intensity Detection with Soft Cues ✅

**Problem**: Intensity=0.0 appearing too often. Missing soft arousal cues like booster words, commas, conversational emphasis.

**Solution**: Enhanced `compute_expressed_intensity()` with:
- 9 booster words: "really", "very", "so", "super", "extremely", "incredibly", "absolutely", "totally", "utterly"
- Comma density as soft arousal proxy (pauses, lists, emotional rhythm)
- Tanh smoothing for saturation curve

```python
# BEFORE: analyzer.py
intensity = min(exclamations * 0.2, 0.5) + min(caps_density * 2, 0.3) + min(elongation_count * 0.1, 0.2)

# AFTER:
booster_count = sum(1 for word in boosters if word in text_lower)
comma_density = text.count(",") / len(words)
intensity_raw = (
    1.2 * min(exclamations, 3) +
    0.8 * caps_ratio +
    0.8 * min(elongation_count, 2) +
    0.6 * (booster_count / len(words)) +
    0.4 * min(comma_density, 0.5)
)
intensity = np.tanh(0.8 * intensity_raw)  # Smooth saturation
```

**Results**:
- Calm text: intensity **0.0** (no caps/exclamations) ✅
- Emphatic text ("SO many days!!"): intensity **0.971** ✅
- Soft cues detected without false positives

---

## 3. Expanded Emotion Vocabulary ✅

**Problem**: Emotion map missing nuanced states (pride, shame) while having good coverage of negative extremes.

**Solution**: Added to `EMOTION_MAP`:
```python
"pride": (0.6, 0.5),       # Low arousal positive (accomplishment, satisfaction)
"shame": (-0.8, 0.5),      # Mid arousal negative (self-conscious guilt)
```

Verified existing coverage:
- "anxiety": (-0.6, 0.8) - High arousal negative ✅
- "hopelessness": (-0.9, 0.2) - Very negative, low arousal ✅

**Impact**: Better detection of self-conscious emotions and quiet pride.

---

## 4. Expanded Risk Patterns ✅

**Problem**: Conservative risk detection (good) but missing gentle expressions of distress.

**Solution**: Added gentle variants to risk patterns:

```python
# SELF_HARM_PATTERNS (now 11 total)
"better off gone"
"don't want to be here"

# HOPELESSNESS_PATTERNS (now 12 total)
"no point in living"
"can't do this anymore"
```

**Philosophy**: Conservative expansion - only added clear distress signals that maintain low false-positive rate.

---

## 5. Tuned Dynamics Parameters ✅

**Problem**: Parameters (α=0.3, β=0.4, γ=0.2) caused state to drift back to baseline too quickly, reducing event responsiveness.

**Solution**: Updated `.env` defaults:

| Parameter | Before | After | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| **ALPHA** (baseline drift) | 0.3 | **0.1** | Less reversion to baseline, state stays responsive longer |
| **BETA** (shock impact) | 0.4 | **0.5** | Stronger impact from events, more sensitive to changes |
| **GAMMA** (ERI influence) | 0.2 | **0.08** | Reduced penalty, prevents over-correction from ERI |

**Impact**: State now more responsive to events while maintaining temporal coherence.

---

## 6. Direction Vector Normalization ✅

**Problem**: Using `np.sign()` for direction caused over-boosting at emotion extremes (e.g., anger at -0.9 valence, 0.9 arousal).

**Solution**: Replaced sign function with proper vector normalization:

```python
# BEFORE: dynamics.py update_state()
dir_v = np.sign(invoked["valence"]) if invoked["valence"] != 0 else 0
dir_a = np.sign(invoked["arousal"] - 0.5) if invoked["arousal"] != 0.5 else 0

# AFTER:
v_inv = invoked["valence"]
a_inv_centered = invoked["arousal"] - 0.5
magnitude = np.sqrt(v_inv**2 + a_inv_centered**2)
if magnitude > 0:
    dir_v = v_inv / magnitude
    dir_a = a_inv_centered / magnitude
else:
    dir_v = 0.0
    dir_a = 0.0
```

**Impact**: Prevents over-correction at emotion extremes, smoother state transitions.

---

## 7. Observability Logging ✅

**Problem**: No visibility into intermediate calculations during analysis without reading JSON output.

**Solution**: Added structured stderr logging in `cli.py`:

```python
# After feature extraction:
click.echo(
    f"[FEATURES] emotion={features['invoked']['emotion']} "
    f"v={features['invoked']['valence']:.2f} a={features['invoked']['arousal']:.2f} "
    f"intensity={features['expressed_intensity']:.3f} tone={features['expressed_tone']} "
    f"awareness={features['self_awareness_proxy']:.2f} risk={len(features['risk_flags'])}",
    err=True
)

# After dynamics computation:
click.echo(
    f"[DYNAMICS] v={dynamics['state']['v']:.3f} a={dynamics['state']['a']:.3f} "
    f"base=({dynamics['baseline']['valence']:.2f},{dynamics['baseline']['arousal']:.2f}) "
    f"shock=({dynamics['shock']['valence']:.2f},{dynamics['shock']['arousal']:.2f}) "
    f"ERI={dynamics['ERI']:.2f}",
    err=True
)
```

**Example output**:
```
[FEATURES] emotion=joy v=0.79 a=0.80 intensity=0.971 tone=positive awareness=0.34 risk=0
[DYNAMICS] v=0.434 a=0.558 base=(0.00,0.30) shock=(0.79,0.50) ERI=0.41
```

**Impact**: Easy debugging, performance monitoring, no stdout JSON pollution.

## 8. Baseline Anchoring Validation ✅

**Problem**: Ensure baseline computation uses proper chronological window and robust fallbacks.

**Solution**: Reviewed `persistence.py`:
- ✅ Uses `ZREVRANGE` on sorted set for last N reflections
- ✅ Returns in chronological order (reversed)
- ✅ Fallback to `(0.0, 0.3)` only if no reflections
- ✅ Baseline computed as simple average of recent invoked states

**Decision**: No exponential smoothing added to baseline itself - the state update rule `(1-α)·s_{t-1} + α·baseline` already provides temporal smoothing. Adding another layer might over-smooth.

## Test Results

All 4 acceptance tests continue to pass:

| Test | Emotion | Valence | ERI | Intensity | Risk Flags |
|------|---------|---------|-----|-----------|------------|
| Positive Social | joy | 0.77 | 0.47 | 0.0 | [] |
| Work Stress | anger | -0.54 | 0.27 | 0.0 | [] |
| Neutral Routine | neutral | 0.0 | 0.07 | 0.027 | [] |
| Risk Detection | hopelessness | -0.55 | 0.10 | 0.0 | [self_harm, hopelessness] |

**Comparative Analysis** (Calm vs Emphatic Positive):

| Text | Intensity | ERI | State (v, a) |
|------|-----------|-----|--------------|
| "Met my friends after many days; felt great and lighter." | **0.0** | **0.47** | (0.35, 0.54) |
| "Met my friends after SO many days!! It felt REALLY great and lighter, honestly." | **0.971** | **0.41** | (0.43, 0.56) |

✅ ERI properly scales with intensity  
✅ Soft cues detected (boosters, caps, exclamations)  
✅ State reflects emotional congruence

**Extreme Emotion Test**:
- Text: "I am absolutely FURIOUS!! This is utterly unacceptable!!!"
- Emotion: anger (v=-0.53, a=0.90)
- Intensity: **0.999** (perfect detection)
- ERI: 1.10 (expected high due to extreme invoked state)
- Direction normalization: Working (state at -0.26, 0.60 - not over-boosted)
