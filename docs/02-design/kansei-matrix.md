# Kansei Engineering Matrix

## Emotional Targets
Kansei = Emotional response to design

| Emotion | Design Element | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Calm** | Soft colors, slow animations | Dusk palette, 600ms transitions |
| **Playful** | Pig character, micro-interactions | Lottie animations, sound effects |
| **Intentional** | Minimal UI, focused interactions | Single CTA per screen |
| **Safe** | Rounded shapes, warm tones | Border-radius: 16px+, pink/beige |
| **Curious** | Unexpected details | Easter eggs, poetic copy |
