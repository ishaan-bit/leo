# Microcopy Style Guide

## Voice & Tone
- **Voice**: Gentle, present, poetic
- **Tone**: Calm but alive, minimal but warm

## Formatting Rules
- Use sentence case (not Title Case)
- Max 10 words per line
- Avoid exclamation marks (unless genuine delight)
- Use ellipses for pause, not incompleteness

## Button Copy
- ✅ "Begin"
- ✅ "Let's meet"
- ✅ "Name my pig"
- ❌ "Click here"
- ❌ "Submit"
- ❌ "Continue →"

## Examples

### Good
> "I need a name...  
> What should I call you?"

### Avoid
> "Please enter a name for your pig to continue!"

## Localization Notes
- Keep sentences short for easier translation
- Avoid cultural metaphors
- Test RTL layouts (future: Arabic/Urdu)
