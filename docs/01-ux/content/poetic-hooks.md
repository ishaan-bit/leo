# Poetic Hooks

## Naming Prompts
- "Every friend needs a name..."
- "What should I call you?"
- "I'm yours now. Name me?"

## Micro-Ritual Invitations
- "Take three slow breaths with me"
- "Notice one beautiful thing nearby"
- "Say something kind to yourself"
- "Think of someone you miss"

## Error States
- **Failed scan**: "Hmm, try pointing at me again?"
- **Network error**: "The connection's shy today. One more time?"
- **Invalid input**: "That's a lovely name, but I need something shorter"

## Exit Messages
- "I'll be here whenever you need me"
- "Thank you for naming me"
- "Scan again anytime, friend"

## Tone Guidelines
- Warm, not cute
- Simple, not simplistic
- Invitational, not pushy
- Culturally neutral (avoid idioms)
