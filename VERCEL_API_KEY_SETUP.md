## Verification

Once deployed, test with a Hinglish reflection:

```bash
curl -X POST https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app/api/reflect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pigId": "test_pig",
    "originalText": "aaj bahut accha din tha",
    "inputType": "notebook",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "rid": "refl_...",
  "data": {
    "raw_text": "aaj bahut accha din tha",
    "normalized_text": "It was a very good day today",
    "lang_detected": "mixed"
  }
}
```

Check logs:
- Go to: https://vercel.com/ishaan-bit/leo/logs
- Search for: `[TRANSLATION]`
- Should see: `translate_success` with `lang: 'mixed'`

---

## Done! üéâ

Your translation system is now:
- ‚úÖ Working in local dev
- ‚úÖ Code pushed to GitHub
- ‚è≥ Waiting for API key in Vercel (5-minute task)
- ‚è≥ Ready to deploy to production

Every reflection will now have proper English in `normalized_text`!
