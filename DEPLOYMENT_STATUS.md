```

### Step 2: Check Response

**Before (Old Deployment)**:
```json
{
  "normalized_text": "Kafi Dinon bad Doston Se Milkar bahut Achcha Laga"  ‚ùå
}
```

**After (New Deployment with API Key)**:
```json
{
  "normalized_text": "It felt really good to meet my friends after a long time"  ‚úÖ
}

```bash
# Test API directly
curl -X POST https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app/api/reflect \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "pigId": "test_pig",
    "originalText": "aaj bahut khush hun",
    "inputType": "notebook",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
  }'

# Should return:
# "normalized_text": "I am very happy today"
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Translation Still Not Working After 2 Minutes:

1. **Check deployment status**: Must show "Ready" (not "Building")
2. **Hard refresh browser**: Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R
3. **Check Vercel logs**: Look for `[TRANSLATION]` entries
4. **Verify env var**: Go back to Vercel settings, confirm key is there

### If You See Errors:

- Check if API key has restrictions applied (HTTP referrers)
- Verify key is not expired
- Check Google Cloud billing (should be $0)
