# Song Worker V4 - Curated Library Implementation

**Date:** 2024-10-29  
**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED**  
**Commit:** `836c7ee`

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Before:** Song worker was using complex YouTube search logic that caused:
- ❌ Timeouts (>600s) on slow connections
- ❌ Unreliable search results (generic searches, wrong songs)
- ❌ Complex emotion→genre mapping that often missed
- ❌ Heavy API usage (multiple searches, filters, retries)

**After:** Curated library with YouTube validation:
- ✅ **Deterministic**: Artist + Track known in advance (no search ambiguity)
- ✅ **Fast**: Single YouTube API call to validate URL (<5s)
- ✅ **Rotation**: 4 choices per emotion combo, cycles through them
- ✅ **Reliable**: Fallback to next choice if URL validation fails

## 📚 Curated Library Structure

### English Songs (210 combos)
**Artists:**
- Pink Floyd (Progressive rock, emotional depth)
- B.B. King (Blues, raw emotion)
- Rush (Progressive rock, philosophical)
- Classic Rock (Led Zeppelin, Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.)

**Example:**
```json
{
  "primary": "sad",
  "secondary": "lonely",
  "tertiary": "isolated",
  "songs": {
    "PinkFloyd": {
      "artist": "Pink Floyd",
      "track": "Comfortably Numb"
    },
    "BBKing": {
      "artist": "B.B. King",
      "track": "The Thrill Is Gone"
    },
    "Rush": {
      "artist": "Rush",
      "track": "Tears"
    },
    "ClassicRockFallback": {
      "artist": "Led Zeppelin",
      "track": "Since I've Been Loving You"
    }
  }
}
```

### Hindi Songs (210 combos)
**Artists:**
- Mohammed Rafi (Classic Bollywood, emotional depth)
- Jagjit Singh (Ghazals, introspective)
- Kishore Kumar (Versatile, emotional range)
- Mehdi Hasan (Ghazals, poetic)

## 🔄 Rotation System

**Redis Key:** `song_rotation:{user_id}:{lang}:{primary}:{secondary}:{tertiary}`  
**Value:** 0, 1, 2, or 3 (index of choice)  
**Expiry:** 90 days

**Rotation Logic:**
```python
# First visit to sad/lonely/isolated
rotation_index = 0  # Choice #1 (PinkFloyd)

# Second visit to same emotion
rotation_index = 1  # Choice #2 (BBKing)

# Third visit
rotation_index = 2  # Choice #3 (Rush)

# Fourth visit
rotation_index = 3  # Choice #4 (ClassicRockFallback)

# Fifth visit (cycles back)
rotation_index = 0  # Choice #1 (PinkFloyd) again
```

**Benefits:**
- No immediate repeats (4 songs before cycling)
- Personalized per user (different users get different rotations)
- Automatic variety without manual intervention

## ✅ YouTube API Validation

**Purpose:** Verify URL works and meets quality criteria

**Filters Applied:**
1. **Duration:** < 10 minutes (600s) — No long versions, live recordings
2. **View Count:** > 1,000 views — Ensures video is available
3. **Likes:** Decent engagement (song-specific)
4. **Availability:** Public or unlisted (not private/deleted)

**Validation Flow:**
```
1. Search YouTube: "Pink Floyd Comfortably Numb"
2. Get top 5 results
3. Fetch video details (duration, views, likes)
4. Filter: duration < 600s, views > 1000
5. Return first valid URL
6. If validation fails → Try next rotation choice
7. If all fail → Fallback to "Never Gonna Give You Up" (Rick Astley)
```

## 🚀 Deployment

### Song Worker Changes

**New File:** `curated_music_selector.py`
- Loads `english songs.json` and `hindi songs.json`
- Implements rotation tracking with Upstash REST API
- Validates YouTube URLs with YouTube Data API v3
- Returns `(youtube_url, artist, track)` tuple

**Updated:** `main.py`
- Replaced `generate_songs_with_youtube()` with `generate_songs_with_curated()`
- Removed complex search logic
- Simplified to single `select_track()` call per language
- Updated health check to show curated library stats

## 🔍 Edge Cases Handled

1. **YouTube Video Deleted/Private**
   - ✅ Validation fails → Try next rotation choice
   - ✅ All 4 fail → Fallback song

2. **YouTube API Quota Exceeded**
   - ✅ Return search URL instead of direct link
   - ✅ User can manually search

3. **Invalid Emotion Combo**
   - ✅ Log error, return fallback song

4. **Redis Connection Failure**
   - ✅ Default to rotation index 0
   - ✅ No rotation, but songs still work

5. **Long Videos (>10min)**
   - ✅ Filtered out during validation
   - ✅ Only songs 3-10min accepted
