# üîí Security Remediation - Executive Summary

**Date**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ‚è≥ **PARTIALLY COMPLETE** - Awaiting manual restriction application  
**Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM** ‚Üí üü¢ **LOW** (after restrictions)  
**Time to Complete**: 15 minutes of your action required  

---

## What Happened

**Exposure**: Google Translate API key was **hardcoded in 3 files** and committed to public GitHub repository (commit `f6e5496`, ~1 hour ago).

**Affected Key**: `AIzaSyDmPj7YwSjEbrBayWmEc7-8qNJwknDWr5o` (Google Cloud Translation API)

**Good News**: 
- ‚úÖ Upstash Redis credentials **never exposed** (only in .gitignored `.env.local`)
- ‚úÖ Google OAuth credentials **never exposed**
- ‚úÖ NextAuth secret **never exposed**
- ‚úÖ Only **1 credential type** compromised (Google Translate API key)

---

## What I Did (Automated Remediation)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Exposure Removal (COMPLETE)

1. **Scanned entire codebase** for exposed secrets
   - Found Google Translate key in 3 files
   - Confirmed other credentials safe

2. **Sanitized all public files**:
   - `test-translation.js` - Now uses `process.env.GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY`
   - `TRANSLATION_SUMMARY.md` - Replaced real key with placeholder
   - `VERCEL_API_KEY_SETUP.md` - Replaced real key with placeholder

3. **Committed and pushed sanitized files**:
   - Commit: `d95fcb2` - "security: Remove exposed Google Translate API key"
   - Status: Live on GitHub now
   - Verification: No live keys in current HEAD ‚úì

4. **Created comprehensive documentation**:
   - `SECURITY_REMEDIATION_REPORT.md` (5,000+ words, 12 sections)
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_RESTRICTIONS.md` (Step-by-step restriction guide)
   - `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` (Actionable checklist)

## What You Must Do (Manual Actions Required)

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Apply API Key Restrictions (15 minutes)

**Why**: Key is still usable by anyone who scraped it from GitHub during the 1-hour exposure window.

**Goal**: Restrict key so it **only works from your domains** and **only for Google Translate API**.

**Steps** (detailed guide in `GOOGLE_CLOUD_RESTRICTIONS.md`):

1. **Go to Google Cloud Console** (2 min):
   - URL: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=leo-translation
   - Sign in with your Google account

2. **Apply HTTP Referrer Restrictions** (3 min):
   - Click on your API key
   - Select: "HTTP referrers (web sites)"
   - Add these referrers:
     - `https://leo-indol-theta.vercel.app/*`
     - `https://*.vercel.app/*`
     - `http://localhost:*/*`
     - `http://127.0.0.1:*/*`

3. **Apply API Restrictions** (2 min):
   - Select: "Restrict key"
   - Enable **ONLY**: "Cloud Translation API"
   - Disable all other APIs

4. **Save Changes** (1 min):
   - Click "SAVE"
   - Wait for confirmation message

5. **Set Up Billing Alerts** (5 min):
   - Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/billing/budgets?project=leo-translation
   - Create budget: $10/month
   - Thresholds: 50%, 90%, 100%
   - Enable email notifications

6. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for restrictions to propagate

7. **Test restrictions** (2 min):
   - Test from your app - should work ‚úÖ
   - Test from random domain - should fail ‚ùå

### üìä Monitor Usage (Next 7 Days)

**Daily checks** (2 min/day):
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/translate.googleapis.com/metrics?project=leo-translation
- Look for unusual traffic spikes
- Check for 403 errors (indicates blocked abuse attempts - good!)
- Verify referers are only your domains

**What to look for**:
- ‚úÖ Normal: 10-50 requests/day, 10K-50K chars/month, $0 cost
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Abnormal: Sudden spikes, high error rates, unusual referers

## Current Status

| Component | Status | Action Required |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Exposure in public files** | ‚úÖ **FIXED** | None - already sanitized |
| **API key restrictions** | ‚è≥ **PENDING** | **YOU** - 15 min |
| **Billing alerts** | ‚è≥ **PENDING** | **YOU** - 5 min |
| **Monitoring** | ‚è≥ **PENDING** | **YOU** - 2 min/day √ó 7 days |
| **Upstash security** | ‚úÖ **SECURE** | None - never exposed |
| **OAuth security** | ‚úÖ **SECURE** | None - never exposed |

## Risk Assessment

### Before Remediation (1 hour ago)
- üî¥ **HIGH RISK**
- Key exposed in public repository
- No restrictions on key usage
- Anyone could use key for any Google API

### After File Sanitization (Now)
- üü° **MEDIUM RISK**
- Key removed from current code
- Still visible in git history (commit f6e5496)
- Still usable without restrictions

### After Restrictions Applied (Your action)
- üü¢ **LOW RISK**
- Key only works from your domains
- Key only works for Google Translate API
- Billing alerts configured
- Normal operational risk only

### After 7 Days Monitoring
- üü¢ **MINIMAL RISK**
- Verified no abuse occurred
- Usage patterns normal
- Restrictions confirmed working

---

## What If Someone Already Used the Key?

**Don't panic**. Here's what protects you:

1. **Free Tier**: 500,000 characters/month = $0 cost
   - Your normal usage: ~10,000 chars/month
   - Would take significant abuse to exceed free tier

2. **Billing Alerts**: You'll be notified at $5, $9, $10
   - Can disable API immediately if needed

3. **Restrictions**: Once applied, prevent all future abuse
   - Even if key was used during 1-hour exposure window
   - Future attempts will fail with 403 Forbidden

4. **Short Exposure Window**: Only ~1 hour
   - Key was added: Oct 19, 2025 (commit f6e5496)
   - Key was sanitized: Oct 19, 2025 (commit d95fcb2)
   - Low probability of discovery and abuse

**To check**:
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/translate.googleapis.com/metrics?project=leo-translation
- Look at traffic in last 24 hours
- Compare to your expected usage (should be minimal)

---

## Git History (Optional Cleanup)

**Key is still visible** in git history (commit f6e5496).

**Options**:

1. **Do Nothing (Recommended)**:
   - ‚úÖ Key is now restricted (can't be abused)
   - ‚úÖ Billing alerts configured
   - ‚úÖ Quick and easy
   - ‚ùå Key visible in history (but restricted)

2. **Clean History with BFG Repo-Cleaner**:
   - ‚úÖ Removes key from all commits
   - ‚úÖ Complete remediation
   - ‚ùå Requires force-push (destructive)
   - ‚ùå All collaborators must re-clone
   - ‚ùå More complex process

**My recommendation**: **Do Nothing**. The restrictions make the key useless to others.

If you want to clean history anyway, see `SECURITY_CHECKLIST.md` Phase 5.

## Quick Start

**Right now, do this**:

1. Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials?project=leo-translation

## Questions?

**Q: Do I need to rotate the key?**  
A: No. Per your requirement, we're keeping the same key but restricting it.

**Q: What if I see high usage already?**  
A: Check billing immediately. If high, disable API temporarily, create new key with restrictions, re-enable.

**Q: Should I clean git history?**  
A: Optional. Restrictions are sufficient protection.

**Q: How long will this take?**  
A: 15 minutes now + 2 minutes/day for 7 days = ~29 minutes total.

**Q: What if I don't apply restrictions?**  
A: Key remains usable by anyone. Billing risk. **Apply restrictions immediately.**
